Polymorphism:

poly => Many
Morphism => Forms

A person plays different or many[poly] roles [forms] in his/her life.
This is called as polymorphism in real life.

a=10
b=20
c=a+b #when operands beside + are numbers then +i s arithmetic operator
print("addition is: ",c)

x="Itvedant"
y="Eclass"

z=x+y #when operands beside + are string then + concatenation operator
print("Value of z is: ",z)

'''

In above program operator + is used as arithmetic operator
when operands are integer,+ is used as concatenation operator
when operands are string.

Thus single operator playing two different role, i.e., arithmetic
and concatination operator based on operands.

Single operator + has two forms. This is called as operator
overloading which is means to achieve polymorphism.
